%S_parameter
Normally an electrical network can be considered as a 'black box', which contains amounts of interconnected basic electrical circuit components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and transistors etc. On this 'black box' may exist many ports, which present the entries or exits of the network. In order describe the characteristics of this network H-Parameters are used, which describe the relation between voltages and currents. In Fig. \ref{fig:2_port_network} is a 2-port network $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ are total voltages of both ports; $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are total currents of both ports respectively. Relations between voltages and currents are like (\ref{eq:voltage_current}).

\end{figure}

\begin{align}
V_{1}&=h_{11}I_{1}+h_{12}V_{2}\\
I_{2}&=h_{21}I_{1}+h_{22}V_{2}
\label{eq:voltage_current}
\end{align}
Where $h_{11},h_{12},h_{21}$ and $h_{22}$ are H-Parameters and defined in (\ref{eq:h_parameters1}-\ref{eq:h_parameters2}).
\begin{align}
h_{11}&=\frac{V_{1}}{I_{1}}|_{V_{2}=0}\quad h_{12}=\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}|_{I_{1}=0}
\label{eq:h_parameters1}\\
h_{21}&=\frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}}|_{V_{2}=0}\quad h_{22}=\frac{I_{2}}{V_{2}}|_{I_{1}=0}
\label{eq:h_parameters2}
\end{align}
But H-Parameters cannot always be valid for the description of microwave circuits. Agilent\cite{aglient_s_parameters} has listed some problems of H-Parameters in high frequency:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is not easy to measure the total voltage and total current at the ports of the network.
\item Short and open circuits are not always available for a broad frequency band.
\item For high frequency some circuit are not stable in short or open conditions.
\end{itemize}
Scattering parameters or S-parameters are perfect description of microwave circuit\cite{RF194_s_parameters}. In that case traveling waves are applied instead of total voltages and currents. $E_{i1}$ and $E_{i2}$ represent incidence waves over left and right ports of the network respectively. $E_{r1}$ and $E_{r2}$ are reflective waves. The relation between traveling waves, total voltages and curents has relations (\ref{eq:voltage_wave1}-\ref{eq:voltage_wave2}).
\begin{align}
V_{1}&=E_{i1}+E_{r1}\quad V_{2}=E_{i2}+E_{r2}
\label{eq:voltage_wave1}\\
I_{1}&=\frac{E_{i1}-E_{r1}}{Z_{0}}\quad I_{2}=\frac{E_{i2}-E_{r2}}{Z_{0}}
\label{eq:voltage_wave2}
\end{align}
Traveling waves themselves can be expressed in terms of H-Parameters (\ref{eq:er1}\ref{eq:er2}). 
\begin{align}
E_{r1}&=f_{11}(h)E_{i1}+f_{12}(h)E_{i2}
\label{eq:er1}
\\
E_{r2}&=f_{21}(h)E_{i1}+f_{22}(h)E_{i2}
\label{eq:er2}
\end{align}
Here $f11, f12, f21, f22$ are the network parameters, which indicate the relation between traveling voltages waves and total voltages or currents. Divide both sides of the functions(\ref{eq:er1}-\ref{eq:er2}) by $\sqrt{Z_{0}}$( $Z_{0}$ system impedance).A new set of variables are defined:
\begin{align} 
a1&=\frac{Ei1}{\sqrt{Z_{0}}}=\frac{V_{1}+I_{1}Z_{0}}{2\sqrt{Z_{0}}} \quad a2=\frac{Ei2}{\sqrt{Z_{0}}}=\frac{V_{2}+I_{2}Z_{0}}{2\sqrt{Z_{0}}} \\
b1&=\frac{Er1}{\sqrt{Z_{0}}}=\frac{V_{1}-I_{1}Z_{0}}{2\sqrt{Z_{0}}}  \quad b2=\frac{Er2}{\sqrt{Z_{0}}}=\frac{V_{2}-I_{2}Z_{0}}{2\sqrt{Z_{0}}}
\end{align}
So relations of the new variables are give by:
\begin{align}
b_{1}&=S_{11}a_{1}+S_{12}a_{2}\\
b_{2}&=S_{21}a_{1}+S_{22}a_{2}
\end{align}
or in matrics form:
\begin{equation}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			b_{1}&\\
			b_{2}&
		\end{pmatrix}
	=	
		\begin{pmatrix}
			S_{11}&S_{12}\\
			S_{21}&S_{22}
		\end{pmatrix}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			a_{1}&\\
			a_{2}&
		\end{pmatrix}
\label{eq:s_matrix}
\end{equation}

The S-Parameters are defined as following:
\begin{align}
S_{11}&=\frac{b_{1}}{a_{1}}|_{a_{2}=0}\\
S_{21}&=\frac{b_{2}}{a_{1}}|_{a_{2}=0}\\
S_{22}&=\frac{b_{2}}{a_{2}}|_{a_{1}=0}\\
S_{12}&=\frac{b_{1}}{a_{2}}|_{a_{1}=0}
\end{align}
The phical meaning of the S-Parameters are described as following:
\begin{itemize}
\item $S_{11}$ is the input port reflection coefficient
\item $S_{12}$ is the reverse gain
\item $S_{21}$ is the forward gain
\item $S_{22}$ is the output port reflection coefficient
\end{itemize}
In another hand, $S_{21}$ is often used to estimate the transmission ability of a network. Therefore $S_{21}$ equals the coupling efficiency in this work.
