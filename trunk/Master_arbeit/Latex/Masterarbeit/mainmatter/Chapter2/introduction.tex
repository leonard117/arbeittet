Introduction Fiber-to-Chip coupling by microlenses are widely used to couple waveguides which are located on a semiconductor chip to single-mode fibers. The development of fiberpigtailed modules is aimed at minimizating the size of the optical system in order to ensure to simple and reliable package, i.e., to minimize potential misalignments due to variations in environmental conditions (especially in temperature). We saw in the previous section that theoretical considerations, I.e., the minimization of spherical and chromatic aberrations, aim at the same goal, namely to minimize the focal lengths and thus to reduce the physical size of the corresponding hardware.  In this article the application of the fiber-to-chip is discussed.

This Article is about the coupling between single-mode fibers and optical waveguide
