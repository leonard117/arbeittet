\subsection{Tapered waveguide due to interface width} 
%tapered_width
Considering the beam spot diameter of about $1.5\mu$m at the working location, the taper width in this case can be designed greater than $1.5\mu$m. Here we discuss the tapered waveguide starting with $1.6\mu$m to match the beam spot. Fig. \ref{ fig:tapered_waveguide_wxx} presents the coupling behavior of the tapered waveguide along the variation of the interface width. From the figure it can be told that the coupling efficiency of this arrangement rise firstly with the width increasing and achieve its peak value at the width$=2$ and $2.2\mu$m. Then the efficiency falls along the interface width. This phenomenon can be explained that a wider interface can confine more incident wave into propagation tunnel but if the interface expands too wide, other aspects may cause the decline of the coupling ability over the effect of the interface width.
