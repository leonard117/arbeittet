%\section{Tapered waveguide}
%tapered_waveguide
Tapered waveguide is composed of a regular waveguide and a taper interface, whose dimensions in the tapered section changes slightly along the longitudinal direction\cite{linear_tapered_waveguides}. Tapered structure enables the waveguide to receive more light so that this structure can improve the coupling efficiency between beam source and waveguide.\\  

Nathaniel in \cite{design_fabrication_tapered_waveguide} has presented two general types of tapered waveguide: conventional taper like Fig. \ref{fig:conventional_taper} and inverse taper. For a conventional taper the entry is wider than the exit while for an inverse taper the entry is narrower than the exit. Because the entry of the inverse taper has smaller dimensions than that of beam spots in this work, only the conventional taper will be discussed in this section.\\

Two taper properties, the width $d_{1}$ of a taper interface and the divergence angle $\theta$ of the taper, may strongly affect the coupling efficiency. For convenient calculations our simulations will be arranged respectively due to variations of taper width and taper length $L_{taper}$.
