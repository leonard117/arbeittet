%lensed_waveguide_extension
Besides the previous discussion about the lensed waveguide, there are more operations we can resort to. From \cite{integrated_coupling_between_LD_SMF} more ideas can be found to promote the coupling efficiency between TLF and lensed waveguide. The author has presented a tapered core fiber like Fig.\ref{fig:tapered_core_fiber}, which is capable to confine more beam rays. In this configuration there is a small distance $h_{1}$ between the lens end $H_{1}$ and core interface $H_{2}$, because the lens end is not the exact minimum spot location for a lensed waveguide. Thus it is possible to gain a higher coupling efficiency, if the distance between the lens and the core is expanded properly and this part of waveguides can be named as 'neck' (see Fig. \ref{fig:lensed_waveguide_neck}).\\

For a proper length $h_{1}$ of the 'neck'  higher coupling efficiency should be achieved. Through brief simulations in Fig. \ref{fig:s21_neck}, we can conclude that neck length does affect the coupling efficiency. Because this setup has 3 variables (lense hight, lens radius and neck length), more research can be done for the optimal arrangement.\\
