Moreover, there are other optional designs for tapered waveguide can be involved to improve the Fiber-to-Chip coupling.  
In the other simulations of coupling between TLF and tapered waveguide there is another interesting result. If the taper is made from a proper material different from both guide and substrate, a more efficient coupling can be achieved in compare with our previous designs. For example, for a taper chosen for $n=2.0$, $w=2\mu$m and $h=5\mu$m the coupling efficiency reaches $\%$.  Because this design is not easy for fabrication, in this section no more attention will be paid on it.   

\cite{tapered_plasmonic_waveguides} mentions a tapered plasmonic waveguide, which is composed of a taper shape metal film on the dielectric substrate.  Under surface Plasmon polariton (SPP) wave 
 
\cite{fiber_to_chip_grating_waveguides} provide a inversely tapered waveguide with gratings.
