
Form this section we aim to find out the geometric effect of lensed waveguide and the lens is made from the same material with the substrate. Here we are going to change the lens property height with a constant lens radium. In Tab. \ref{tab:coupling_lensed_waveguide_height} the coupling efficiency for these arrangements are collected. The results can also be presented as Fig. \ref{fig:coupling_lenses_curve_rxx}, from which the coupling behaviors between TLF and lensed waveguide

Compare these values with that of the coupling between TLF and basic buried waveguide, a proper designed micro lens on the waveguide can greatly improve the coupling efficiency. And it can also be found from Fig. \ref{fig:coupling_lenses_curve_rxx} that for a fix radium the most efficient lens configuration exist at the highest lens height or a hemisphere lens. But an exact hemisphere structure (height$=2\mu$m,Radium$=2\mu$m) may be not so easy for fabrication. Therefore the second efficient configuration (height$=1.6\mu$m,Radium$=2\mu$m) can be an optimal option.

The reason of the efficiency change can be explained by Fig.  \ref{matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx}-\ref{matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx2}. From the former cure Fig. \ref{fig:Tapered_core_spot_curve} we can tell that beam spot size at the working distance is bigger than the dimensions of the waveguide interface and from Fig. \ref{matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx2} we understand the reason because rays near margin are penetrating mostly into substrate. In Fig. \ref{matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx} rays near margin are refracted and focused to axis, so that the beam spot size decreased and more rays concentrate into waveguide so that the coupling become more adaptable.

For more information we can draw the Fig. \ref{fig:lensed_guide_spot_size_ curve}. And the spot sizes changing agree well with the corresponding coupling efficiency.
