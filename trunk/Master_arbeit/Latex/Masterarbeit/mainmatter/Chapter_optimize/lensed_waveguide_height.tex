In this section we aim to find out the effect of the lens geometric to the coupling, while the lensed interface is made from the same material with the substrate. Here we are going to maintain the guide end at the distance of $4\mu$m from the TLF and lens radius as a constant. Meanwhile the lens height $h$ is varying from $0.4\mu$m to $3\mu$m. Tab. \ref{tab:coupling_lensed_waveguide_height} obtains the coupling efficiency for these arrangements. It is apparently, the coupling efficiency in this case has greatly be improved in compare with that of the coupling for regular buried waveguide in section \ref{sect:optim_lensed_regular}. These simulation results can also be presented as Fig. \ref{fig:coupling_lenses_curve_hxx}, from which the coupling behaviors between TLF and lensed waveguide.\\

It can also be found from Fig. \ref{fig:coupling_lenses_curve_hxx} that the most efficient lens configuration exist at the highest lens height when the radius of the lens is fixed. In another word a hemisphere lens is the best coupling configuration. But an exact hemisphere structure (height$=2\mu$m,Radius$=2\mu$m) may be not so easy for fabrication. Therefore the second efficient configuration (height$=1.6\mu$m,Radius$=2\mu$m) must be  an optimal option among simulations.\\

The reason of the efficiency change can be explained by lens theory with Fig.  \ref{fig:matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx}-\ref{fig:matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx2}. From Fig. \ref{fig:matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx} we can tell that beam spot size at the working distance is bigger than the dimensions of the waveguide interface and from Fig. \ref{fig:matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx2} we understand the reason because rays near margin are penetrating mostly into substrate. In Fig. \ref{fig:matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx} rays near margin are refracted and focused to axis, so that the beam spot size is decreased and more rays are concentrated into waveguide to make the coupling become more efficient.\\

\end{figure} 
Meanwhile we can analyze the spot size of these arrangements due to the variation of lens heights and draw the Fig. \ref{fig:lensed_guide_spot_size_curve}. Curves in Fig. \ref{fig:lensed_guide_spot_size_curve} reveal that spot sizes changing agree well with the corresponding coupling efficiency inversely.
