%optimize_introduction
This chapter aims to discuss the optimize methods so that the Fiber-to-Chip coupling efficiency improved. Four ideals are engaged in this chapter. One thought is to relocate the waveguide; another is to change the round condition of the coupling. The application of a taper interface at the beginning of the waveguide is involved in the next consideration. The last thought is to mount a lens at the waveguide interface.
