%optimize_introduction
This chapter aims to discuss the optimization methods to improve the Fiber-to-Chip coupling efficiency. Five proposals will be obtained in this chapter. One is to relocate the waveguide. Another is to replace the round condition of the simulation setup with oil. In the third proposal we will consider to change the composed material of the waveguide.  The application of a taper interface at the beginning of the waveguide is involved in the next consideration. At last we are going to mount a lens at the waveguide end face.
