As beginning of this chapter the waveguide model will be approximate with a rectangle waveguide. Place the waveguide at the working distance $4\mu$m before the TLF.  Fig.\quad\ref{fig:coupling_e_field} from the simulation of this configuration shows the E-Field spread more widely at the interface of the waveguide than that in the case without blockage of the waveguide and apparently a great part of E-Field infiltrate into the waveguide rather than accepted by guide. Thus by checking the S-parameter of this simulation Fig.\ref{fig:orignial_coupling_efficiency},which present the S21 in frequencies, the coupling efficiency ($S_{21}$) is about $48.8\%$ at the working frequency $282$HZ($\lambda=1064$nm). This result will act as the reference sample for the other simulations.

Furthermore people can analyze the power distribution at the guide from Fig.\quad\ref{fig:power_distribution}( see Appendix.\quad\ref{app:powwer_distribution} ). In the figure it can be found that about $40\%$ power propagates in the guide while another $40\%$ in the substrate and the rest is losing in the air or reflecting.
