In this chapter the configurations of the experimental objects and corresponding technical detail will be at first introduced. Then it will be described the detail how the simulation models are approximated in CST MWS (CST Studio suite 2010) and the some performances of the simulations will also be illustrated in compare with the practical objects, such as working distance, minimum spot size, power distribution, etc .
