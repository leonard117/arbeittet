%optics
In this part the  some theorems from the geometric optics  are introduced as the basic knowledges.

Fiber optics
When a light ray is incident from a medium of refractive index $n$ to the core of index $n_{1}$, Snell's law at medium-core interface gives
\begin{equation}
nsin\theta_{max}=\sqrt{n_{1}^2-n_{2}^2}
\label{snell}
\end{equation}
