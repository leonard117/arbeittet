	algorithm based on a statistical model constructed in the acoustic
	echo cancellation framework. In the proposed approach, all the possible
	near-end and far-end signal conditions are classified into four distinct
	hypotheses, and the power spectral density estimation is carried
	out according to the result of hypothesis testing. The distribution
	of each signal component is characterized by a parametric model,
	and the conventional likelihood ratio test is performed to make an
	optimal decision. The experimental results show that the proposed
	algorithm yields improved performance compared to that of the previous
	RES technique.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a representation for discrete signals and systems
	based on short-time Fourier analysis.
	
	The short-time Fourier transform and the time varying frequency response
	are reviewed as representations for signals and linear time-varying
	systems.
	
	The problems of representing a signal by its short-time Fourier transform
	and synthesizing a signal from its transform are considered.
	
	A new synthesis equation is introduced that is sufficiently general
	to describe apparently different synthesis methods reported in literature.
	
	It is shown that a class of linear-filtreing problems can be represented
	as a product of the time-varying frequency response of the filter
	multiplied by the short-time 
	
	Fourier transform of the input signal. The represenation of signal
	by samples of the short-time Fourier transform is applied to the
	linear filtering problem.
	
	This representation is of practical significance because there exists
	a computationally efficient algorithm for implementing such systems.
	
	Finally, this methods of fast convolution are considered as special
	case of this representation.},
