Coupling fibers to photonic waveguide leads to normally great energy loss at optical transmissions. This work aims to discuss the coupling interface between tapered and lensed fibers and photonic waveguides and streamline the coupling ability. For this purpose we carried out the analysis by applying numerical simulations with the help of CST MWS and Matlab programs. \\

In this work we have arranged the simulations on following consideration, including relative locations, material composing and waveguide structures. For relative locations we shifted the waveguide in a small range along x, y and z axis respectively. For material composing we have executed simulations in specified surrounding conditions or by changing the waveguide materials.  Simulations for different waveguide structures in this work base on the taper technique and the lens technique. For these simulations we analyzed the coupling efficiency by changing the geometric parameters of both structure.\\

Through the comparison of simulation results we can conclude that changing waveguide material, using tapered or lensed waveguide structures are optimal options. For a realizable implementation we should also consider fabrications and cost of above options.
