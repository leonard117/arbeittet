Coupling fibers to photonic waveguides leads to normally heavy energy loss at optical transmissions. This work aims to discuss the coupling interface between tapered and lensed fibers and photonic waveguides and promote the coupling ability. For this purpose we carried out the analysis by numerical simulations with the help of CST MWS (CST Microwave Studio\textregistered) and Matlab programs. \\

For this discussion we arranged the simulations on following considerations, displacing the waveguide, changing material composing of the waveguide and reforming the waveguide structure. For displacement of the waveguide we shifted the waveguide in a small range along x, y and z axis respectively. For material composing we executed simulations in specified surrounding conditions or by changing the waveguide materials. For reform of the waveguide structure the taper technique and the lens technique were involved in waveguide structures. \\

Through the comparison of simulation results we can conclude that changing waveguide material and the use of tapered or lensed waveguides leads to an enhancement of transmission efficiency.
