Coupling fibers to photonic waveguides leads to normally severe energy-loss at optical transmissions. This work aims to discuss the coupling interface between tapered and lensed fibers and photonic waveguides and promote the coupling ability. For this purpose the analysis is carried out by numerical simulations with the help of CST Microwave Studio\textregistered\hspace{0.1cm}(CST MWS) and Matlab programs. \\

For this discussion simulations are carried out on following considerations, displacing the waveguide, changing material composition of the waveguide and reforming the waveguide structure. To work out the dependence of coupling efficiency on displacement of the waveguide the waveguide is shifted in a small range along X, Y and Z-Axis respectively. The dependence on material composition is reviewed by simulations in specified surrounding conditions or by changing the waveguide materials. The effect of the waveguide structure is determined by the use of two techniques, namely the taper technique and the lens technique. \\

Through the comparison of simulation results it can be concluded that changing waveguide material and the use of tapered or lensed waveguides leads to an enhancement of transmission usage.
