In this part the  some theorems from the geometric optics  are introduced as the basic knowledges.

\subsection{Fiber optics}
Optical fibers are widely used as a medium for telecommuniction and networking because of varity of advantages.It is flexible,especially permits transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than other forms of communication. The Fig.\ref{fig:opticfiber} presents a simplest optical fiber and how lights progate in the fiber.

Optical fiber typically consists of a transparent core with index $n1$ surrounded by a transparent cladding material with a lower index of refraction $n2$. The Light is kept in the core by total internal reflection. This causes the fiber to act as a waveguide.
In \cite{script_FT_TET} the principle of the total reflection is explained with Snell's law. When a light or wave pass through a boundary between two different isotropic media, it behaves after Snell's law, which is presented in following mathematical fomular (\ref{lab:snell}).

\begin{equation}
n_{1}sin\theta_{r}=n_{2}sin\theta_{t}
\label{lab:snell}
\end{equation}



\theta_{t} is transmission angle or refraction angle.
