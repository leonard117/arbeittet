In this section we consider shifting the waveguide to affect the light properties in second propagating track. As a 3D model the waveguide can be shifted on transverse and or longitude directions as Fig. \ref{fig:shift_all_axis}.

According results in the table we can draw curves in Fig. \ref{fig:shift_curve}, which presents coupling efficiencies due to waveguide shifting. For transversal shifting among range $-0.5\mu$m to $0.5\mu$m the coupling efficiency falls very quickly in vertical or horizontal directions from $48.9\%$ to about $32\%$.  In another word, the coupling efficiency stands for the highest value of $48.9\%$ when there is not shifting in transversal directions. From this Figure it can also be revealed that coupling efficiencies are symmetric due to positive and negative X-Axis shifting. While the coupling efficiencies due to negative and positive Y-Axis shifting are not symmetric. This trend can be explained by the geometric characteristic of the waveguide, which is same in X-Dimension and different in Y-Dimension.  In longitudinal direction among the shifting range $-0.5\mu$m to $0.5\mu$m the lowest coupling efficiency is $46\%$ at distance $3.5\mu$m from TLF, while the highest coupling efficiency of $49.7\%$ due to shifting along Z-Axis stands not at working distance $4\mu$m but $4.3\mu$m, which agree with the estimation of minimum spot location about $4.26\mu$m at section \ref{sect:model_model_model_TLF}. \\

Through above discussions following can be concluded:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Shifting in transversal directions cannot improve the coupling efficiency and obviously affect the coupling ability. 
\item Shifting in longitudinal direction can gently affect the coupling ability. 
\end{itemize}
Although the location the minimum spot lies not on the working distance $4\mu$m, displacement of the waveguide cannot obviously improve the coupling efficiency, difference of $1\%$. Hereby the working distance will be maintained in following simulations.\\
