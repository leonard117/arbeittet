In agreement with the waveguide in the experiment, the buried waveguide model like Fig. \ref{fig:buried_waveguide} in this section obtains the identical dimensions ($w01\mu$m and $h00.5\mu$m) and refractive indexes (n$_{1}$ and n$_{2}$) with the original waveguide.\\ 
Fig. \ref{fig:curve_coupling_basic_buried_waveguide} shows the coupling efficiency between TLF and the regular buried waveguide due to the frequencies. The coupling efficiency at the working frequency $282$THz reaches about $51.3\%$, which is relative higher than that of the stripped rib waveguide. This value will be referred for further discussion about coupling from TLF to the lensed waveguide.
