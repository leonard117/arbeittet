%basic_buried_waveguide
In agreement with the waveguide in the experiment, the buried waveguide model likes Fig. \ref{fig:buried_waveguide} is created with the same corresponding parameters. The waveguide in this section contains the identical dimensions ($w$ and $h$) and refractive indexes (n$_{1}$ and n$_{2}$) with the original waveguide.

Fig. \ref{fig:curve_coupling_basic_buried_waveguide} shows the coupling efficiency between TLF and the basic buried waveguide due to the frequencies. The coupling efficiency at the working frequency $282$THZ reaches about $51.3\%$, which is relative better than stripped rib waveguide. We will refer this value for further discussion about coupling between TLF and the lensed waveguide.
