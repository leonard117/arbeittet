Moreover, there are other optional designs for tapered waveguide can be involved to improve the Fiber-to-Chip coupling.\\
\textbf{Hybrid tapered waveguides}\\  
In the other simulations of coupling between TLF and tapered waveguide there is another interesting result. If the taper is made from a proper material different from both guide and substrate, a more efficient coupling can be achieved in compare with our previous designs. For example, for a taper chosen for $n=2.0$, $d_{1}=2\mu$m and $L_{taper}=5.5\mu$m the coupling efficiency reaches $|S_{21}|=63\%$.  Because this design is not easy for fabrication,no more attention will be paid on it in this section.

\textbf{Tapered plasmonic waveguides}\\
\cite{tapered_plasmonic_waveguides} mentions a tapered plasmonic waveguide, which is composed of a thin tapered metal film with small holes on the dielectric waveguide Fig. \ref{fig:tapered_waveguide_plasmonic}. By transmission input beams excite the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave, which is explained by quantum emission, provided by the metal/dielectric interfaces of the plasmonic waveguides.

In this configuration the coupling efficiency can even achieve a value greater than $100\%$. 

\textbf{Grating tapered waveguides}\\
The author of \cite{fiber_to_chip_grating_waveguides} has provided a inversely tapered waveguide with gratings Fig. \ref{fig:tapered_waveguide_grating}. The gratings of this waveguide are  delicately designed to match the work mode: bloch mode. In \cite{fiber_to_chip_grating_waveguides} the auchor presented his achievement of $65.6\%$ coupling efficiency.
