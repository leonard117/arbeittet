%tapered_waveguide
Tapered waveguide is inhomogeneous waveguide on shape, whose dimensions in the tapered section changes slowly along the longitude dirccetion\cite{linear_tapered_waveguides}. Tapered structure enables the waveguide to receive more light so that improve the coupling efficiency between beam source and waveguide.  
The author of \cite{design_fabrication_tapered_waveguide} has presented two general types of tapered waveguide: conventional taper like top view Fig. \ref{fig:conventional_taper} and inverse taper like top view  Fig. \ref{fig:inverse_taper}. For a conventional taper the entry is wider than the exit while for an inverse taper the entry is narrower than the exit. In this section the conventional taper will be discussed.

Two properties, the width $d_{1}$ of a taper interface and the divergence angle $\theta$ of the taper, of the taper may strongly affect the coupling efficiency. For convenient calculations our simulations will be arranged respectively due to variations of taper width and taper length $L_{taper}$ instead of divergence angle.
