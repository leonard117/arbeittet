In this section we aim to find out the effect of the lens height $h'$ on the coupling, where the lensed interface is made from the same material of the substrate. Here the guide end face is kept at the distance of $4\mu$m from the TLF and lens radius as a constant. Meanwhile the lens height $h'$ is varying from $0.4\mu$m to $3\mu$m. \\

Tab. \ref{tab:coupling_lensed_waveguide_height} shows 3 group of simulation results for lens radius of $R=2\mu$m, $2.5\mu$m and $3\mu$m and Fig. \ref{fig:coupling_lenses_curve_hxx} presents these results as curves. It can be seen that coupling efficiencies of each group are rising with the lens height increasing.  The coupling efficiency for the lens radius of $R=2.0\mu$m rises from $54\%$ at $h'=0.4\mu$m to $69\%$ at $h'=2.0\mu$m; the coupling efficiency for the lens radius of $R=2.5\mu$m rises from $53.4\%$ at $h'=0.4\mu$m to $68.8\%$ at $h'=2.4\mu$m; the coupling efficiency for the lens radius of $R=3.0\mu$m rises from $52.9\%$ at $h'=0.4\mu$m to $68.9\%$ at $h'=3.0\mu$m. Therefore, the most efficient lens configuration exists at the highest lens height when the radius of the lens is a constant. In another word a hemisphere lens is the best coupling configuration. \\

From simulation results it can be seen that the highest coupling efficiency in this case has significantly be improved in compare with the coupling efficiency of $51.3\%$ for regular buried waveguide in section \ref{sect:optim_lensed_regular}.\\

The reason of the efficiency change can be explained by lens theory with Fig. \ref{fig:matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx}-\ref{fig:matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx2}, which exhibits light propagating from TLF to the lens structure of the lensed waveguide. The left-hand arc presents the end of TLF and the right-hand half circle presents the lens structure of the lensed waveguide. $d_{spot}$ is the spot diameter at the waveguide end face. In Fig. \ref{fig:matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx} rays are not refracted by right-hand lens structure and $d_{spot}$ is about $2.4\mu$m. Fig. \ref{fig:matlab_coupling_lenses_rxx2} demonstrate that rays are refracted by right-hand lens, which has refractive index of $n=2.516$. In this case $d_{spot}$ is decreased less than $2.0\mu$m . That means, light power is confined in a smaller area and the coupling become more efficient. To verify this derivation we can check the spot size at the waveguide end face from CST MWS.\\

\end{figure}  
Fig. \ref{fig:lensed_guide_spot_size_curve} demonstrates spot size curves of 3 lens radii due to lens height at the end face of lensed waveguides. At the smallest lens height $h'=0.4\mu$m the spot size has highest values, about $1.05\mu$m for $R=2\mu$m, $1.07\mu$m for $R=2.5\mu$m and $1.08\mu$m for $R=3\mu$m. At the maximal lens height the spot size has minimum values, about $0.89\mu$m for $h'=2\mu$m and $R=2\mu$m, $0.91\mu$m for $h'=2.4\mu$m and $R=2.5\mu$m, $0.89\mu$m for $h'=3\mu$m and $R=3\mu$m. Curves in Fig. \ref{fig:lensed_guide_spot_size_curve} reveal that spot sizes changing agree well with the corresponding coupling efficiency inversely.\\
