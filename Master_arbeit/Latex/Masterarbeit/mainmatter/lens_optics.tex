%Lens optics
Lenses are widely used in optics. In this work lenses are used for coupling fibers to photonic waveguide. No matter what kind of application they all base on primary rules: lens theory.\\

One important function of lenses is focus. It is a common experience by using a magnifying glass to set small pieces of paper or leaves on fire with sunlight. In this scene the lens of the magnifying glass focuses all incoming sun rays at a single spot. This spot is called focal point and the distance between the focal point and the center of the lens is called focal length $f$. The dimensions of this spot and the focal length are two primary characteristics parameters of the lens and values of them depend on the radius of the lens surface and on the refractive index of the material the lens is made from. \\

In order to understand more specifics about lenses Fig. \ref{fig:lens_define}  presents a singlet lens with geometric parameters. 'The optical axis (O-O') of the lens is a line passing through the centers of curvature of the two spherical lens surfaces.'  
Rays A and B, parallel with the optic axis (O-O'), are casted from different two sides through the lens and respectively cross the axis at their front and back focal points $F1$ and $F2$. The front and back principal points $H1$ and $H2$ are the intersections of the optical axis with the front and back principal surfaces. Points $V1$ and $V2$ are called the front and back vertices respectively\cite{lens_theory_LC_Ltd}.  Some important quantities are defined in Tab. \ref{tab:lens_quantities}. \\

The classical singlet lenses are plano convex, plano concave, equiconvex and equiconcave lenses, which are listed in following Tab. \ref{tab:lenses_focal_length} with their focal length relation. The performance of a lens is usually estimated by spot size and focal lengths. The definition of the spot size will be declared later in section \ref{sect:gaussian_beam}. The focal length is the distance from lens center to minimum spot. But this idea is not exact in any case.  Here we can testify this thought by Fig. \ref{fig:focal_length} and following equations (\ref{eq:snell_focal}-\ref{eq:focal_length}).\\

In Fig. \ref{fig:focal_length} there is a plano convex lens with radius $R$ and index $n$. The optic axis (O-O') passes through the lens center.  The light source $a$ emits a ray parallel with the optic axis (O-O') and at the point $b$ on the lens surface is refracted. At last the refracted ray cross the optic axis (O-O') at point F. $\theta$ is the input angle, $\psi$ the output angle and $\phi$ the angle from output ray to optic axis (O-O'). According the SNELL's LAW we get the relation between $\theta$ and $\psi$ in (\ref{eq:snell_focal}). $\phi$ and $\psi$ has the relation like (\ref{eq:psi_phi}). Then the distance $L$ from point H to F is given by (\ref{eq:focal_length}). When $\theta$ is close to 0 like (\ref{eq:focal_length_app}) $L$ is right equal the formula of Plano Convex in Tab. \ref{tab:lenses_focal_length}. So this formula of focal length is only valid for a small angle lens. 
\begin{equation}
L=R\left[ -1+\frac{n}{n-1}\right]=\frac{R}{n-1}
\label{eq:focal_length_app}
\end{equation}

Following we will discuss the focal length of a wide-angle lens. \cite{lens_theory_LC_Ltd} has referred that the minimum spot lies between the maeginal plane and paraxial focal plane. All distances which are in following discussed base on the assumption that the back vertex (V2) of the lens is regarded as origin. In Fig.\ref{fig:min_max_spot} there are 'geometrical traces of 25 rays in the focal region 100mm focal length plano convex lens (n=1.515).'  'The rays are launched parallel to the axis (O-O') and equally spaced in a region above and below the axis in a plane containing the axis (\textbf{meridional plane})'. The marginal plane (\textbf{MP}) goes through the focal point of marginal rays. The paraxial focal plane (\textbf{PP}) goes through the focal point of paraxial rays. 'The distance from \textbf{PP} to \textbf{MP} is the \textbf{longitudinal spherical aberration LAm}'. The minimum spot (\textbf{MS}) is located at the plane, which is approximately 3/4 LAm back toward the lens from the \textbf{PP}.\\
