%Lens optics
At your childhood you may have the experience by using a magnifiying glass to set small pieces of paper or leaves on fire with sunlight. The lens of the manifying glass focuses all incoming light rays at a single point. espeically for the rays parallel with the lens' axis the single point of the lens is called focal point and the distance between the focal point and the center of the lens is called focal length $f$.
The focal length of a lens depends on the radii of curvature of its surface and on the index of the refraction of the material the lens is made from. In oder to undertand more specifics about lenses a singlet lens with geometric parameters is presented in Fig.\ref{fig:lens_define}.

The optical axis (O-O')of the lens is a line passing through the centers of curvature of the two spherical lens surfaces. 
Rays A and B,parallel with the optic axis (O-O'), are  casted from different two sides through the lens and respectively cross the axis at their front and back focal points $F1$ and $F2$. The front and back principal points $H1$ and $H2$ are the intersections of the optical axis with the front and back principal surfaces. Points $V1$ and $V2$ are called the front and back vertices respectively. So important Quantities are defined in the Tab.\ref{tab:lens_quantities}.

The distance $t_{c}$ is the center thinckness of the lens $V1V2$. 






The classical singlet lenses are plano convex, plano concave, equiconvex and equiconcave lenses, which are listed in following Tab.\ref{tab:lenses_focal_length} with their focal lengths.

High quality singlet lensese are of particular interest in laser focusing and beam handling applications because of their low cost, high damage threshold, and availability of a large variety of standard parts. ..................

Spot size,which introduced in section \textbf{Gaussian Beam}, is also a important quality of a lens. The smaller minimum spot size a lens has, the stronger focusing ability it has.  For a small angle lens the smallest spot locate approxmiately at its focus. But for a wide angle lens it is a different case.
Artikel form "` Laser COMPONENTs"' has refer that the minimu Spot lays between the maeginal plane and paraxial focal plane. Fig.\ref{fig:min_max_spot} is a "'geometrical trace of 25 rays in the focal region 100mm focal length BK7 plano convex lens(n=1.515)."' All the distances which are in following discussed base on the assumption that the back vertex (V2) of the lens are regarded as origin(0 point). The rays are launched parallel to the axis(O-O') and equally spaced in a region above and below the axis in a plane containing the axis(\textbf{meridional plane}). Therefor, the lens is operating at the rahter "`faster"' aperture of f/3.125. The marginal rays reach the axis first,in plane \textbf{MP}. The paraxial rays reach the axis lasr, at the \textbf{paraxial focal plane}(\textbf{PP}). The Distance from \textbf{V2} to \textbf{PP} is the back focal distance (\textbf{BFD}) of the lens. This can be verified using the formulas previously defined. The distance from \textbf{PP} to \textbf{MP}, here negative, is the \textbf{longitudinal aberration LAm} of the marginal rays. The beam width in the paraxial focal plane PP is the \textbf{transverse spherical aberration TSAm}, determined by the heights of the marginal rays. Notice that the smallest geometrical spot size can be found at plane \textbf{MS}, approximately 3/4 LAm back toward the lens from the paraxial focal plane. Later, this algorithmus will be used to veritfy the lens design in our simulations.
