In this chapter the modelling process of the experimental setup will be addressed. Firstly, we will describe the experimental arrangement and the corresponding technical details. Then through the approximation of these technical details the fiber-to-chip models for the simulation can be constructed with the aid of CST MWS. At the end of this chapter, the original arrangement is simulated for addressing the unoptimized performance.
