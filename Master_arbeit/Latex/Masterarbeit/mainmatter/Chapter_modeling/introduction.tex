Fiber-to-Chip coupling by microlenses is a very common problem in integrated optics \cite{ integrated_optics}, in wich single-mode fibers with a lensed end couple to waveguide made from semiconductor. By means of this technology the simple and reliable optical system with a small size become possible because a lensed fiber has a minized focal length. In this article the application of the lensed fiber-to-chip will be introduced and it coupling efficiency will be discussed.
