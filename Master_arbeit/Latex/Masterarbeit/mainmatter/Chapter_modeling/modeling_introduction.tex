%modeling_introduction
In \cite{nanoscal_tapered_fiber} the maximum diameter of the TLF in experimental setup is $150\mu$m, which is very larger than the working wavelength $\lambda=1064$nm and the dimensions of the waveguide, $w\approx 1\mu$m, $h\approx 0.5\mu$m. If a full-size TLF model is used, it takes a great long time for the simulation. For an economic simulation there is no need to create exactly identical models and only parts of the specifics are requested for modelling. In this section the modelling process will be discussed.
