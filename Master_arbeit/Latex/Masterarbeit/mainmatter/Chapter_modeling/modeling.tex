% Problem description
The left side is a lensed tapered fiber as laser source and at the right side at the working distance there is a chip formed waveguide as signal receiver.  The purpose is to find a way to gain optimized coupling efficiency through the simulations in CST MWS Environments. 


Following is a typical demonastration of fiber-to-chip coupling.
